SpatialOS and VR Research Writeup
---
#Activities
+ ##Monday:
    Went through the documentation of SpatialOS (https://docs.improbable.io/reference/11.0)
    Install SDK and its dependencies ( A lot )
        Java, Unity 5.6.0, and others
    Start reading the docs of the tutorial

+ ##Tuesday:
    Explored the code Pirates Tutorial, a fully functional MM game.
    Explored the VR Starter project of SpatialOS (https://github.com/spatialos/VRStarterProject)
    Tested the cloud deployment
    Many logic has to be written in the scripts.
    Handling server side behaviours
   
   
+ ##Wednesday:
    Used the VR Starter project to create a Personal VR project
    Handling the controller and VR camera in SpatialOS logic.
    OT: I tried the Github plugin for Unity, It seem unstable now.
+ ##Thursday:
    Created my personal Entities living in the server with their behaviors
    Playing with Inspector, a view to your online created world
   
+ ##Friday:
    Analyzed performance of the project and solve some bugs.
    Tried to create a game logic ( TBC )


Consideration:
    SpatialOS is very useful to create MM Online experiences also for VR.
    You need to code in the script many logics, but it’s funny.
    You need a right sequence to build the things in order to work.
    There is a diagram for this: https://docs.improbable.io/reference/11.0/developing/local/build
   
You can find sample code project in:
